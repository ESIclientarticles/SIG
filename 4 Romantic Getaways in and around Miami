<p>There are nearly infinite things for couples to see and do within Miami, but being willing to drive (or boat) to destinations outside the city only expands your possibilities. Making the 3.5-hour trip down to Key West, for example, offers unforgettable ocean sunsets and some of the most ridiculously fresh seafood you’ll ever lay taste buds on. </p>
<p>Or, you could immerse yourself in nature during an airboat ride in the Everglades.</p>
<p>Picking your own fruit at a citrus grove or strawberry patch is another amazing idea that doubles as a stock-up on hotel room snacks (and easy gifts to bring back to loved ones).</p>
<p>Put simply, there’s almost no wrong choice out there when it comes to having a romantic getaway in or near Miami! Couples who come here are sure to leave closer together than ever before.</p>
